# hdWGCNA_paper

This repository contains the code used to perform the data analysis in the [hdWGCNA paper (Morabito et al., 2022)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.22.509094v1). If you are looking for the [hdWGCNA R package](https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/), please visit [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/smorabit/hdWGCNA/).


We organized the code used to generate the figure panels into R markdown notebooks (.Rmd) files for each figure. This code was run on the [UC Irvine HPC3 resource](https://www.oit.uci.edu/services/research/hpc3/), so you will notice some paths to files on this system throughout the repository which may not be relevant to those trying to reproduce the results of this paper. We also have included all of the scripts used to re-process the publicly available datasets used throughout the manuscript.
